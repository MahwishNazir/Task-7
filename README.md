**SPECKit Plus**: is a fremane work with slash commands, templates and project scaffolding. it gives built in criteria of the project that need to fullfill for better understanding of AI tools.

1️⃣ **/constitution**: is the core criateria of the project. Example: if the project is "construction of home", that needs Bricks, Cement, sand and iron etc but every home have differnt placeholder of walls but the constitution of the wall is always and every where same.

2️⃣ **/specify**: As we are using AI as tool so we have to give a clear instructions that comes in specification folder. we  have to define clearly what the idea is OR what the idea we want.

3️⃣ **/plan**:when we have specifications then it need to understand, how to plan to fulfill thiese specifications. it comes in plan and this plan is devided into some components: 1. Architectural components, 2. Implementation phase, 3. Dependencies, 4. Design decisions

4️⃣ **/tasks**: All tasks cannot perform at once. so when we have specifications and plan so that is devided into small tasks  to perform it well.

5️⃣ **/implement**: Now the project is ready to do work on it so its easier to perom tasks one by one, efficently according to plan and specificatons. there is nothing left to instruct AI(tool).
